Hello.

In this tutorial I will explain how you can connect to your free vps via ssh on a linux desktop.

If you don't have a free vps, you can get one by following our [tutorial](/articles/free-vps).

## Connecting
1. Open a terminal
2. type: `ssh root@IP -p PORT`. Change `IP` and `PORT` with the vps details
3. If it asks something, just type: 'yes'
4. Type your vps password (it will not display it on screen)
5. Hit enter
6. You are connected :D
