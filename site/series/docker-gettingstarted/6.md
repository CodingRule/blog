Hello.

You've just ran the hello world docker container, which simply outputs a simple message.
But what if we want to create a container running debian.

This is possible by running
```bash
docker run --rm -ti debian:latest bash
```
This will create a debian container (`latest` version) and run `bash` in it to get a shell.
The `--rm` flag will destroy the container after exiting. This is nice for testing.
The `-ti` makes the terminal interactive, so you can actually type stuff in it.

In the next part, you will learn how you can expose ports.
